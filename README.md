# Lab-Week-1-prefix-sums
You must first clone this program using "git clone"

To the run the program you first need to compille  main.cpp (g++ -c main.cpp -o main.o -std=c++17) and prefixSum.cpp (g++ -c prefixSum.cpp -o prefixSum.o -std=c++17). You then must link them using "g++ main.o prefixSum.o -o executableName" and then run the executable using "./executableName", this will run the program. To run the tests you must also compile tests.cpp (g++ -c tests.cpp -o tests.o -std=c++17) and link it to prefixSum.o using the same command used above to link main with prefixSum. You may then run the tests by using the "./" command followed by whatever you name the executable.
